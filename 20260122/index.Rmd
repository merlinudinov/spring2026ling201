## **Welcome to Linguistics**
<br>
.pull-left[
**language** is something that comes naturally to us as human beings:
- We acquire our native language(s) as children simply by interacting with peers and caregivers<br><br>
- We use language to socialize, communicate, interact – nearly everything we do!<br><br>
- And we often use language without being consciously aware of it<br><br>

**language** is also extremely complicated:
- *Cambridge Grammar of the English Language* takes **1,860** pages to describe English
sentence structure – and it's still not complete!

## **Course Goals**
<br><br>
Linguistics tries to make sense of this complicated system, and findings from linguistics have given us a lot of insight into how language works – but there's still more to learn <br><br>
So in this course, we're going to learn about how to analyze language from a linguistic point of view. We'll first learn some basics about language and linguistics. Then we'll spend 1-2 weeks on:<br><br>
- **Morphology** – the study of word structure
- **Syntax** – the study of sentence structure
<br><br>
- **Semantics** – the study of how (literal) meaning is derived from words and phrases
- **Pragmatics** – the study of how (implied) meaning is derived from language in context
<br><br>
- **Phonetics** – the study of the physical properties of speech sounds (or signs)
- **Phonology** – the study of speech sounds (or signs) as a system

1. Does the word end in a sibilant consonant? *(s, z, sh, zh, ch, j)*

## **Linguistic Rules**
<br>
- One goal of **Linguistics** is to *figure out the rules that explain how language works*<br><br>

- All varieties of all languages follow systematic rules, and all speakers have these rules as part of their **mental grammar**, aka their **linguistic competence**
  - grammatical rules may be **unconscious**: we largely use them without being aware of it
  - even **non-standard varieties** have grammatical rules
  - **every speaker** of **every language and variety** has a mental grammar<br><br>
  
- throughout the semester, we'll keep coming back to this idea of a **mental grammar**, we'll learn ways to figure out how grammar works at every level:
  - sounds
  - words
  - sentences
  - conversations<br><br>

- when we say grammar, **we're talking about what people** ***really do***, and not necessarily what they're "supposed" to do according to textbooks or English class

3. Run your experiment, **collect** your data<br><br>
4. **Analyse your data** - is your hypothesis true or false?<br><br>
5. Based on your results, update your theories, develop a new hypothesis, and **repeat**!

Come up with a hypothesis – a statement that could be true or false – about English modals. (Ideas: Where specifically? What about other modals: can, may, should, oughta? Does anyone use more than 2?) <br><br>
