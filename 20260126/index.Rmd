- a native speaker of a language L knows a lot about L:
  - possible/impossible <span style="color:blue"><b>sounds</b></span> and <span style="color:blue"><b>sound combinations</b></span> of L
  - possible/impossible <span style="color:green"><b>sentences</b></span> of L
  - possible/impossible <span style="color:orange"><b>meanings of novel sentences</b></span><br><br>
- but this knowledge is **unconscious**<br><br>
- linguists investigate what this **unconscious knowledge** consists of<br><br>
- in other words, linguistics is **descriptive** and linguists try to “recover the unconsciousness”
  - describe how people naturally speak

## **Step 1: Observation**
<br>
.pull-left[
- in casual spoken English, the verb be may be used in either its **full or reduced (contracted) forms**:<br><br>
  - (Where is the train?)
  - <i>**It is** at Penn Station</i>.
  - <i><span style="color:green"><b>It’s</b></span> at Penn Station</i>.<br><br>
  - (Pointing at Merlin)
  - <i>**He is** the best candidate for the job</i>.
  - <i><span style="color:green"><b>He’s</b></span> the best candidate for the job</i>.<br><br>
  - <i>**We are** happy when we are together</i>.
  - <i><span style="color:green"><b>We’re</b></span> happy when we are together</i>.

.pull-right[
<img src="../pic/0126/safescience.jpg" width="100%">
]

---
### **Step 2: Generalisation**
<br>
.pull-left[
- an English speaker knows that the reduced form of **BE** may appear wherever its full form appears
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

### **Step 3: Initial Hypothesis**
<br>
- contraction is <span style="color:green"><b>fully optional</b></span>

.pull-right[
<img src="../pic/0126/safescience.jpg" width="100%">

## **Step 4: Test Hypothesis**
<br>
.pull-left[
- gather more data/observations to test the **Initial Hypothesis** <br><br>
  - (two people are waiting for the train. One says to the other...)
  - <i>I wonder where **it is**</i>.
  - \* <i>I wonder where <span style="color:green"><b>it's</b></span>.<br><br>
  - <i>Everyone thinks that Merlin is the best candidate for the job and in fact **he is**</i>.
  - \* <i>Everyone thinks that Merlin is the best candidate for the job and in fact <span style="color:green"><b>he's</b></span></i>.

.pull-right[
<img src="../pic/0126/safescience.jpg" width="100%">
]

---
## **Step 5: Revise Hypothesis**
<br>
.pull-left[
- ~~contraction is <span style="color:green"><b>fully optional</b></span>~~ <br><br>
- a reduced form of be may appear wherever its full form may appear, **unless it occurs at the very end of a sentence** <br><br>
  - (two people are waiting for the train. One says to the other...)
  - <i>I wonder where **it is**</i>.

## **Step 6: Go Back to Data**
<br>
.pull-left[
- a reduced form of be may appear wherever its full form may appear, **unless it occurs at the very end of a sentence** <br><br>

- but still...
  - <i>They will never be as happy as we are when **we are** together</i>.
  - \* <i>They will never be as happy as <span style="color:green"><b>we're</b></span> when we are together</i>.<br><br>
  - <i>I wonder where **it is** right now</i>.

.pull-right[
- our hypothesis is **falsified** and it’s important that the hypothesis is <span style="color:green"><b>falsifiable</b></span><br><br>
- we are **predicting** something at least<br><br>
- English speakers know a rather **sophisticated** rule that governs the use of reduced forms<br><br>
- this rule is just one small piece of an immensely rich body of knowledge that English speakers acquire without any explicit instruction, and which remains **below the level of conscious awareness**<br><br>
- coming up with a descriptive rule that correctly depict linguistics phenomenon is **HARD**

  - $*$ <i>John has finishing his homework</i>.
  - $*$ <i>This apples is delicious</i>.<br><br>
- speakers may disagree on what is grammatical based on their own mental grammar <br><br>
- language can be **non-standard** but still **grammatical**<br><br>
  - <i>How about them apples!</i>
  - <i>I don't want none!</i>

## **Standard vs. Non-standard Language**
<br>
.pull-left[
- since we take **descriptivism**, we need to **avoid** judgmental terms <br><br>
  - ~~bad grammar~~
  - ~~incorrect language~~
  - ~~broken English~~
<br><br>
- **standard language**: the variety taught in schools and used in **formal and official settings** like the workplace, education, government, newsmedia, textbooks, etc.
<br><br>
- **non-standard language**: other varieties used in more colloquial settings <br><br>
- the standard variety is often a bit artificial and no one speaks that way all the time
]

.pull-right[
<img src="../pic/0126/ignor.jpeg" width="75%">
<br><br>
- people may disagree on what counts as standard or non-standard
- non-standard language may be **stigmatized** in some cases, but - it is just as legitimate and expressive as standard language. There is nothing inherently "better" or "worse" about any variety or language
]

---
## **Rules are Variable**
<br>
.pull-left[
- We've seen that language follows mental rules, and that non-standard varieties also have rules<br><br>
- Another important point: the rules of language are often variable<br><br>
- Not everyone speaks the same, and not everyone has the same mental rules<br><br>
- Grammar often varies by region, community, and other social factors but no matter where you're from, you still have a mental grammar
]

.pull-right[
